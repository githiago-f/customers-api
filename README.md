## Key words

`domain` - the main concepts of the project.

### Run tests

The following script will run:

1. domain build;
2. domain test;
3. server test;
4. client test;

It's necessary to build domain before all tests because is a common dependencie used to test data structures and validate all entities of this domain.

```bash
 yarn test
```

### Run server and client

#### Client

```bash
 yarn client start
```

#### Server

```bash
 yarn server start
```
